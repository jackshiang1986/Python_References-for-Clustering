# Python_References for Clustering

This repository provides some reference notebooks related to clustering methods:

  1. K-Means vs. Hierarchical vs. DBSCAN Clustering:
     This notebook demonstrates how we can make use of DBSCAN for properly clustering clusters of arbitrary shapes and varying densities, which is not achievable by using conventional clustering methods, such as K-Means and Hierarchical clustering.

  2. Using Silhouette Score for Evaluation of Clustering Quality by K-Means Method:
     In this notebook, we will use Silhouette Score for evaluation of clustering quality by K-Means method.
